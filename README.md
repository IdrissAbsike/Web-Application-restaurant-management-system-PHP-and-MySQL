There is a much easier way to run PHP, No configuration needed:

install the Code Runner Extension
open the PHP code file in the text editor
use a shortcut Ctrl + Alt + N
or press the F1 key then select / type Run Code,
or right-click on the Text Editor, then click on Run Code in the context menu of the editor
or click on Run Code button in editor title menu
or click on Run Code button in the context menu of the file explorer
in addition, you can select part of the PHP code and run the snippet code. Very convenient!
